## What is this thing?

This wiki is a collection of files managed by a piece of software called [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a _version control system_ - it keeps track of different versions of files, and allows different users to collaborate on them. It's written in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), a simple language for describing web pages.

You can see all the code that makes this wiki in our [Github repository](https://github.com/seaquamrobotics/vex-v5-programming). If you have a suggestion or spot a mistake, you can record it on the [issues page](https://github.com/seaquamrobotics/vex-v5-programming/issues).
